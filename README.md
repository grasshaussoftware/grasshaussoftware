Brent K. Kohler, known online as "deusopus" and on X as "@freehempseeds," is a multifaceted professional at the intersection of software architecture and blockchain innovation. Based in Wenatchee, Washington—a region that blends agricultural heritage with emerging technology—Brent integrates technical expertise with advocacy for the cannabis economy and secure digital identities. His early literacy (reading by age two) and involvement with Bitcoin since 2011 highlight a deep-rooted commitment to digital frontiers and community-driven solutions. This detailed profile synthesizes verified information from trademarks, academic records, GitHub repositories, public platforms, and community sources, offering a comprehensive overview as of early 2026, while acknowledging the evolving nature of blockchain technologies.

### Academic Background
Brent earned his Bachelor's in Information Technology from Purdue University Global in 2020. As an accredited online affiliate of Purdue University, the program emphasizes software development, programming, and foundational IT skills. It prepares students for certifications such as CompTIA and Microsoft, fostering expertise in data management, cybersecurity, and application design. The curriculum's practical focus aligns directly with Brent's blockchain projects, providing a solid foundation for real-world applications. Despite ongoing debates about the equivalence of online degrees to traditional ones, the program's accreditation and positive employer reception validate its effectiveness for adaptable, career-oriented individuals.

### Professional Journey
Brent's career showcases versatility across technical and creative roles:
- **Game Testing at Nintendo of America**: Involved in quality assurance for gaming consoles, sharpening skills in detail-oriented problem-solving and systematic testing.
- **Social Media Direction at Grass Haus Studios**: Managed digital marketing efforts, potentially with a cannabis focus, enhancing abilities in community building and online engagement.
- **Founding Cannacoin Community Foundation**: Established in 2019, Brent secured U.S. Trademark No. 7,110,096 for "Cannacoin" (Serial No. 90683788) on September 26, 2023, covering currency exchange and virtual trading services. Originating from 2014 Reddit discussions, the project addresses banking restrictions in the cannabis sector through decentralized transactions, promoting economic inclusion amid regulatory challenges and fintech volatility. Brent prioritizes sustainability and community governance in his leadership.

### Key Projects and Innovations
Brent's initiatives apply blockchain to practical challenges, rooted in open-source principles:
- **Cannacoin**: A decentralized cryptocurrency tailored for cannabis advocacy, facilitating secure virtual exchanges. Launched in 2014 as a Scrypt-based Layer-1 blockchain, it transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), with a capped supply of 13.14 million coins and no premine or ICO. Resources include Linktree, Discord, a dedicated wiki, and community hubs like Telegram and Reddit (r/cannacoin). Recent blog posts discuss health implications, legal shifts, and its role in compliant transactions.
- **Smoke**: An extension of Cannacoin as a hybrid PoW/PoS cryptocurrency using the Scrypt algorithm, featuring a fixed supply of 420,000,069 tokens and staking yields up to 893% APY. Conceptual features encompass NFT tracking for supply chains and cannabis-collateralized loans, though these are unimplemented as of late 2025. The mainnet launched in November 2025; it's open-source on GitHub with wallets for Windows and Linux, with repository updates last noted in April 2025, indicating an early adoption phase.
- **ChainID**: A Rust-based digital identity management solution on Avalanche C-Chain, utilizing BIP-39 mnemonics, KYC integration, and ECC (secp256k1) cryptography for privacy through hashing. Version 1.0 was released in March 2025 with AI assistance from Grok 3, including QR code scanning and simulated NFT minting. Recent X posts suggest applications in blockchain-based voter ID. The GitHub repository reflects limited post-release activity with five commits.
- **PiPhi Network**: An Algorand-based platform for smart home and environmental data aggregation, offering token rewards, customizable dashboards, and hyper-local accuracy via H3 hex-grid systems. The mainnet token launched on March 29, 2024, with Tokenomics v2.0 in April 2024. Beta features for developer plugins and a mobile app were expected in Q1 2025 and likely realized by 2026, with lifetime access at $50, emphasizing sustainability.
- **Walk and Talk with Grok**: A Spotify podcast exploring technology, self-discipline, cultural shifts, and innovation, co-hosted by xAI's AI "Bling Bling." The premiere episode released on March 14, 2025; as of early 2026, only one episode is confirmed, bridging tech insights with personal growth themes.

### Community Engagement and Personal Pursuits
Brent actively contributes to his community through volunteer work at his church food bank via Chuck Wagon Ministries, a Christ-centered organization in East Wenatchee, Washington. For several years, he has assisted in collecting and processing donations, supporting the less fortunate in local and underserved remote areas where such services are scarce. The ministry operates weekly at Kingdom Embassy Church, providing free meals and food bank services to the financially and spiritually poor, with a focus on stewardship of donations. In his spare time, Brent not only reads literature and listens to podcasts but also curates music, cooks meals, hangs out with friends, and manages his Wenatchee homestead to promote sustainability and resilience. His recent X activity often touches on personal development, cannabis culture, and blockchain's broader societal impacts, emphasizing integrity and community support.
