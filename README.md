# 🌟 Brent Kohler’s GitHub Haven 🌟

I’m Brent Kohler, a Purdue ‘20 software design grad who’s been coding since I could read at age 2 and diving into crypto since 2011’s Bitcoin and Silk Road days. From Wenatchee, WA, I blend tech grit with artistic soul—think sunflowers, goats, and tiny-house dreams meets blockchain innovation. I founded the Cannacoin Community Foundation, snagging U.S. Trademark Reg. No. 7,110,096 in 2023 for my decade-long virtual currency project tied to cannabis advocacy. A prodigy turned hustler, I’ve road-tripped the U.S. as a kid (buffalo showdowns included), tested games for Nintendo, and now host *Walk and Talk with Grok* on Spotify, sharing self-improvement and tech vibes.

Melding **artistic flair** 🎨 with **tech wizardry** 💻, I’m sharpening Python, React, Rust, and Solidity to push Cannacoin and beyond. My roots run deep—Young Astronauts, 2600 hacker meets in Seattle, and a love for comics and model rocketry fuel my creative fire. On SSDI, I grind for freedom (beer, smokes, maybe a car), nurture connections, and build community through code and conversation. Here’s where it all comes together—let’s make something epic.
