This initiative, originating from 2014 Reddit discussions, tackles cannabis banking restrictions through decentralized transactions, fostering economic inclusion amid regulatory and fintech challenges. Kohler has led the project since 2019, emphasizing sustainability and community governance.

### Key Projects
Kohler's projects demonstrate innovative applications of blockchain in niche sectors:
- **Cannacoin**: A decentralized cryptocurrency for cannabis advocacy, with resources accessible via Linktree, Discord, and a dedicated wiki. Launched in 2014 as a Scrypt-based Layer-1 blockchain, it transitioned from PoW to PoS, with a capped supply of 13.14 million coins and no premine or ICO. Recent blog posts discuss health risks, legal shifts, and Cannacoin's role in secure transactions. Community engagement includes Telegram, Discord, and Reddit (r/cannacoin).
- **Smoke**: A hybrid PoW/PoS extension of Cannacoin using Scrypt algorithm, with a fixed supply of 420,000,069 tokens and staking yields up to 893% APY. Conceptual features include NFT tracking for supply chains and cannabis-collateralized loans, though unimplemented as of late 2025. Mainnet went live in November 2025; open-source on GitHub with wallets for Windows and Linux. Last repository updates in April 2025 indicate early-stage development.
- **ChainID**: A Rust-based digital identity solution on Avalanche C-Chain, using BIP-39 mnemonics, KYC integration, and ECC (secp256k1) cryptography for privacy via hashing. Version 1.0 released in March 2025 with AI assistance from Grok 3; features QR code scanning and simulated NFT minting. Recent X posts suggest applications in blockchain-based voter ID. Repository shows limited activity with 5 commits and no further releases.
- **PiPhi Network**: An Algorand-based platform for smart home and environmental data aggregation, offering token rewards and customizable dashboards. Mainnet token launched March 29, 2024; Tokenomics v2.0 in April 2024. Beta features for developer plugins and mobile app expected in Q1 2025, with lifetime access at $50. Focuses on hyper-local data accuracy and sustainability.
- **Walk and Talk with Grok**: A Spotify podcast exploring tech, self-improvement, and cultural shifts, co-hosted by AI "Bling Bling" from xAI. Premiere episode released March 14, 2025; no additional episodes noted as of early 2026.
