# deusopus: Software Architect and Blockchain Innovator 🚀

I am Brent K. Kohler, a 2020 Purdue University Global graduate in software design, whose career is defined by the convergence of code, cryptography, and purposeful innovation. From Wenatchee, Washington, I have been engaged with technology since mastering literacy at age two and delving into Bitcoin’s emergent ecosystem in 2011. As founder of the Cannacoin Community Foundation, I secured U.S. Trademark Registration No. 7,110,096 in 2023, anchoring a decade-long commitment to virtual currency and cannabis advocacy 🌿. My professional journey spans game testing at Nintendo of America, social media strategy at Grass Haus Studios, and hosting *Walk and Talk with Grok* on Spotify, where I explore technology, discipline, and societal transformation 🎙️.

Rooted in disciplined problem-solving, I am advancing expertise in Python 🐍, React ⚛️, Rust 🦀, and Solidity 💻 to drive groundbreaking projects like Cannacoin, *Smoke*, and ChainID. My intellectual rigor, shaped by early participation in Young Astronauts and Seattle’s 2600 hacker community, informs a methodical approach to developing secure, decentralized systems 🔒. Beyond the digital realm, I cultivate resilience through literature 📚, music 🎶, and stewardship of my Wenatchee homestead, where I prioritize self-sufficiency and community connection 🏡.
